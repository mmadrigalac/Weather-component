# HTML Weather component

Implementation of a weather component using Vanilla JS.
This is a web component that can be instanciated by its own HTML tag including an init location as html attribute.

# API
Currently taking weather information from https://www.metaweather.com/ API.

# Notes:
- Component was created as a self-training for Web component creation.
- Current API used is having CORSS issues since correct heather is not being sent over
  each response as it should.
- Chrome can be used to visualize the component by starting a session with CORSS requirements disabled.
